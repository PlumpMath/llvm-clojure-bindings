2) lein deps
3) lein run

NOTE: The code assumes LLVM is at /opt/local/lib/libLLVM-2.9.dylib For different paths, update jna.library.path java property.

* Input Program 
Here our toy language is used as input into compiler frontend.
#+BEGIN_SRC c
func cos(Double) Double;
func printf(...) Integer;

func bar() Integer {
   printf("foo");
   return 3;
}

func main() Integer {
    printf("hello %d", 3);
    printf("bar ");
    bar();
    return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

* Program Output

1) The intermediate representation is printed.
2) The object file and linked binary is created.
